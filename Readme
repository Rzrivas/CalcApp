Followed the tutorial in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQpxNvmKinw

App works completely changed a few colors.
Button and text names are different to what I normally name variables.
Ran it on a Nexus 5x probably wont look properly on other android phones because of the adjusted sizes.
Included screenshots I got off my phone showing the app.
